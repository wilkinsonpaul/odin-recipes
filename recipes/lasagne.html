    <h2>Make our most popular lasagna today to find out what all the fuss is about!</h2>
    <p>Prepare this easy lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp </strong>olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
        <li><strong>750g </strong>lean beef mince</li>
        <li><strong>90g </strong>pack prosciutto</li>
        <li><strong>800g </strong>passata</li>
        <li><strong>220ml </strong>beef stock</li>
        <li><strong>A pinch </strong>grated nutmeg</li>
        <li><strong>300g </strong>fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li><strong>520g </strong>white sauce</li>
        <li><strong>125g </strong>ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
